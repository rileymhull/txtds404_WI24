            <p>This edition was created as part of the TXTDS 404/504 course at the University of
               Washington</p>
            <p>Special care was put into transcribing the text presented here as diplomatically as
               possible. This edition was created with the intention of providing historical
               recipies for readers for a variery of purposes, be it a study of ingredients
               available, culinary culture of the early 20th century, and kitchen technology.</p>
            <p>Origionally, the source text contained full page advertisments on every other page,
               akin to what is seen in Victorian serials. These have been omitted from our edition,
               as we felt that they were extranious information and rather that the effort should be
               put into including as many recipies as possible.</p>

            <p>The Ladies' Aid Society cook book is an instructional text divided into the following
               sections: Soups, Fish, Meats, Vegetables, Bread, Relishes, Salads, Pies, Cakes,
               Puddings, tables of weights and measure, Candies, and an unnamed section containing
               recipes for household fluids. Each section contains different recipes. First, we
               transcribed ten different pages of recipes from various sections. After some of these
               recipes, there is a name of a person who contributed the recipe to the cookbook. The
               page numbers are at the bottom of each page. Also, since everything is organized
               similarly, we planned to reflect this in our transcription. Finally, we have written
               a diplomatic transcription since our text is so sparse and modern. <bibl>
