            <p>This transcription of Poems was created as our final project submission for Professor Turnovsky's TXTDS 404 course, "Texts, Publics and Publication" at the University of Washington. Poems was chosen amongst various texts provided by the UW Libraries' Special Collections department. Our intention with this transcription was to preserve the content of Eddy's poetry, and provide through our poem selections and annotations a curated understanding of Eddy's beliefs and life. The literary content of the poems and historical period of time they were written in were a central focus in our transcription efforts. </p>

               In 1866, Mary experienced an injurous fall in Lynn Massachusetts, having slipped on a patch of ice. The treatment of this injury involved morphine doses, which Mary continued taking through the end of her life. The fall marked a moment of spiritual revelation for Eddy, who attributed her recovery to teachings from the Bible and subsequently delved further into spititualism and the foundation of Christian Science.

               Christian Science is the religion founded by Mary Baker Eddy. Its followers believe in healing and transformation through spirituality,  specifically through the doctrines and teachings of the Bible. After experiencing her own accident and divine healing, Mary spread her doctrines through her foundational textbook Christian Science and the Church itself. Founded in 1879, Christian Science is still a religion today.

               Science and Health is the foundation scripture of Christian Science, written by Mary Baker Eddy from 1872-1975. The text is 500 pages long, was published by Christian Science Publishing Co., and is available through the organization's website. Christian Scientists refer to Science and Health alongside the Bible within their sermons, the teachings of both being integral to their religion.

            <note>There are two types of line breaks seen in Mary's poetry. An End-Stop is when a line of poetry ends on a period or natural break in the sentence. An Enjambment is when a sentence continues across multiple poetic lines.

            <note>
               Poetic meter refers to the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry. Feet contain the repeated pattern of stressed sylablles, and can contain two or three syllables per feet. 
               Two-syllable feet include Iambs (unstressed / stressed), Trochee (stressed / unstressed), and Spondee (stressed / stressed). Three-syllable feet include Anapests (unstressed / unstressed / stressed) and Dactyls (stressed / unstressed / unstressed).
