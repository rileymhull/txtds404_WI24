               The J.N. Bertram letters are a collection of letters that include personal
               corrisponse, business corrispondece, and newspaper clippings. The material
               transcribed in this edition is a sample from those three categories, including
               handwritten letters, typewritten corrispondece, and newpaper clippings.

               <p>In an effort to preserve authorial intent of manuscript documents, primarily
                  comprised of letters of correspondence, we have chosen to leave all spelling and
                  grammar errors. This choice was done in order for our edition to reflect the
                  people composing the documents and the time period in which they were written.</p>
            </normalization>
            <punctuation>
               <p>Some letters contain no punctuation at all. No corrections were made to preserve authorial voice.</p>
            </punctuation>
            <correction>
               <p>If you discovered errors in your text, you can talk here about where you decided
                  to correct them or not - Errors were left unedited; any mispellings that appear in
                  the text were directly from the source.</p>
